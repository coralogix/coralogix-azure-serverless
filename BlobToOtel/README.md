# Blob To Otel

Coralogix provides a seamless integration with ``Azure`` cloud so you can send your logs from anywhere and parse them according to your needs.

`Blob-to-Otel` function sends logs from Azure Blob Storage to Otel Endpoint, using the EventHub trigger.

As an OTLP endpoint, you can configure either otel-collector endpoint or [Coralogix Opentelemetry endpoint](https://coralogix.com/docs/integrations/coralogix-endpoints/#opentelemetry) to send logs directly to the platform.

## Prerequisites

* An Azure account with an active subscription.

* A storage account with event notifications configured with EventHub as a destination.

* An Otel collector endpoint (available for the function app to reach) or Coralogix Opentelemetry endpoint.
